# Hyper-Paddle
Hyper Paddle is a minimalist, fast-paced take on the classic Pong formula. Two paddles battle to keep a bouncing ball in play — but with a modern twist: vibrant visuals, dynamic speed scaling, and power-ups that change the pace of play.  The goal is simple: don’t miss the ball. The last paddle standing wins.
